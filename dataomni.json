She was drawn in by the blue skies, the picturesque beauty of the lake, the vast National Forest and endless outdoor activities. As an avid hiker and backpacker, she has a vast experience in National Parks and Wilderness Areas such as San Gorgonio Wilderness, John Muir Wilderness and Ansel Adams Wilderness along with Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, Zion and Joshua Tree National Parks. Her greatest accomplishment so far has been hiking 2,000 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail &ndash; a long distance hiking trail reaching from Mexico to Canada. With nearly 40 miles of this iconic trail running directly through Big Bear, there is no better place to train for high altitude mountain hiking. She has volunteered her time to the Bear Valley Search and Rescue Team and the Big Bear Trails Foundation.&nbsp; She is devoted to keeping Big Bear&rsquo;s valued trails in a safe and enjoyable condition for those who are as captivated by nature as she is. In addition to her commitment to local agencies, she dedicates her time and energy to the Pacific Crest Trail Association, the National Park Conservation Association and the Yosemite Conservancy. She is passionate about sharing her love of the mountains and educating others on Leave No Trace principles, the ten essentials and&nbsp; trail etiquette to help make the trails better for the enjoyment of all.",

Densely forested with boulder outcroppings and a seasonal waterfall, this is a gorgeous hike any time of year. The seasonal creek in the Spring and the autumn leaves in the Fall make this a favorite hiking trail for locals and visitors. Castle Rock itself is an impressive granite outcropping with panoramic views of Big Bear Lake. You may get to watch rock climbers scaling the steeper side as you make your way around Castle Rock. This trail has a steep climb that will get your heart pumping for the first half-mile and then levels out as you make your way towards Castle Rock.</span>",

It tends to be a common belief that traveling with pets means exorbitant pet fees - not true. In fact, no matter what type of lodging&nbsp;you're looking for, you can find many that welcome pet guests to stay for a LOW fee that costs, on average, $15-$20 per night. But Golden Bear Cottages resort guests pay only $10 per night. Compare that with keeping your four-legged family member at home with a pet sitter or at a boarding&nbsp;facility. That will cost you an average of $55/night for a pet sitter and $35/night for boarding.",

        "Description": "<p>Escape to this 2 bedroom 1 bath getaway in the heart of the Big Bear Lake resort town. Enjoy being both 'off the beaten path' and central to year round activities. Don't be fooled by the log exterior of this cozy home because the interior features a full kitchen and 'great room' feel not typically shared by traditional cabins. If the sledding hill on the property or the great sledding area behind the property is not enough, the house is within walking distance to the Six Flags run amusement/water park, as well as restaurants and antique shops. Go a little farther in one direction and you will be in the beautiful 'Village', a main hub of shops, brewery's and restaurants. A little farther in the other direction and you can enjoy the scenic Boulder Bay area of the lake, a perfect place to rent kayaks and paddle boards, or just have a family picnic. This place features a romantic fireplace, a larger TV with bluray/DVD/cable functionality, as well as access to your Netflix,Vudu, amd Amazon Prime accounts and a full kitchen with cute dining area. The bedrooms are beautifully decorated with a king size bed in the master bedroom, and a log bunk in the second bedroom that accommodates a full size bed on the bottom and a twin up top as well as a Premium Luxury twin cot, just in case. There is also a huge front deck with patio furniture that can accommodate up to 6 people as well as a deck in the back complete with a Bistro set for those who would rather enjoy the wilder views of nature. For those who just can't get away, there is high speed broadband internet access. All of this and a washer and dryer to get those ski outfits ready for another day on the slopes. So pack light, and please enjoy this place as much as we do!</p>",

Once you've picked the perfect cabin or vacation rental for you and your dog, check out some popular attractions and things to do with your furry friend. We recommend you check out the Grand View Point Trail for a popular six-mile hike through the beautiful forest. If that&rsquo;s a bit too much for your dog, you can try a shorter hike like the Woodland Trail (easy) and Alpine Pedal Path (very easy). </p><p>As a safety precaution, ff you&rsquo;re visiting in summer, make sure to check the temperature of your dog and that they are comfortable the whole time. Dogs can get exhausted easily and you don&rsquo;t want to stress your dog too much during a hike or walk.</p><p>More laid-back options include taking your dog to the shoreline to relax by the lake. </p>",
